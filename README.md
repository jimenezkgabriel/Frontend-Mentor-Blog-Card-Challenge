1. What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?
   The challenge about refactoring old code into Bootstrap for this lab was just getting started with Bootstrap and spending the first few hours reading the documentation and looking up tutorials on how to get started. Other challenges include downloading the Bootstrap .css file and setting that up, looking into scss and trying to give custom
   colors, figuring out how to get GitHub Pages to work properly with Bootstrap CSS.

3. How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
   A lot of padding and margin stuff got standardized across every element and class so spacing is super neat and super clean. There's a component class for a lot of things that I needed, including a card component. There are built in flexbox displays and the whole grid system simplifies web layout.

4. In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?
   I guess if a browser doesn't support Bootstrap somehow.
